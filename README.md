# Python MadLib Instructions

https://github.com/ahookerbrown/CNE310_Adam

This repository (link above) includes a Python file with code that allows you to play a fun and immersive MadLib experience.

## Getting Started

The below instructions will go over installing the necessary software on your Windows machine and running the file within a Windows Command Prompt.

### Prerequisites

The MadLib.py file requires the Python 3.13 interpreter and runtime to run in a Windows Command Prompt. 

```
INSTALLING Python 3.13 Interpreter and Runtime:

1. Open the Microsoft Store app by going to your Start menu, and search for "Microsoft Store" to find the application

2. Within Microsoft Store, search for "python"

3. You will see many versions of Python available, Install the one titled "Python 3.13"

4. Now, you have the required software to run the MadLib.py file
```

## Running

Once you have the necessary Python software installed, the below instructions will teach you how to run the MadLib.py file.

```
RUNNING MadLib.py within a Windows Command Prompt:

1. To open the command prompt you will first need to use the keyboard shortcut "Win + R", which will open the Run application

2. Within the Run application, type in the letters "cmd" and then click "Ok" to open the Windows Command Prompt.

Next, you will need to navigate to the folder where the Python file is located. We do this with the cd command:

4. Command to type in: "cd C:\FolderPath\Where\ThePython\FileIs\Located'. 

If you have just downloaded the MadLib.py file and still have your downloads going to the default Windows folder, you can just use the command "cd downloads".

Next, we need to run the Python File:

5. Type in this command "python .\madlib.py"

```

After following the above instructions, this will run the MadLib.py file within the Windows Command Prompt and you will begin to see the prompts that allow you to type your answers to create your Mad Lib.

## Thanks

I would like to thank my family, my teachers, and my friends.

I would also like to thank Google for leading me to the https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-run-a-python-script/ website, which helped me because I forgot the command to run a script in cmd.
